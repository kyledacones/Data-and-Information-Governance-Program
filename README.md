### A.	<a id="background">BACKGROUND</a>

#### PAST

Merrilton Bank supplies 25,000 commercial and individual customers, with banking and insurance services to 25,000 commercial and individual accounts. Merrilton Bank builds sophisticated algorithms using advanced statistical models. The content of the algorithms supply services on products ranging from credit assessment, risk prediction, and fraud detection. The company’s increasing reliance on these technologies will increase financial risk for the company. While the current situation continues to see incremental linear growth. Merrilton needs an updated operating model of the organization that works to build upon the existing data infrastructure. Continuing without any intervention from key stakeholders, we risk falling behind our competitors. 

#### PRESENT

Due to an economic downturn following the outbreak of COVID-19. The federal government requested commercial banks to roll out a new program backed by a new federal spending bill. The new bill, known as the Small-Business Assistance Program (SBAP), will pump billions of federal dollars directly into small businesses, thought to the hardest hit during the recent downturn. SBAP, now regulated under The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC); under the Department of Treasury, with special provisions and exemptions to hasten the rollout of the new program. The company saw an opportunity to update our existing data infrastructure as well as to counteract the sharp decline in consumer spending. SBAP looks to help the expected economy’s expansion after the increase in vaccination rates. 
Business Analytics Department was optimistic after looking into SBAP’s business case because it shows strong technical feasibility. These new business capabilities supply operational efficiency gains, improved accuracy of decisions, the establishment of an objective and standardized data culture, and finally improved customer satisfaction. Merrilton Bank will bridge old divides people collaborating cross-functionally within the organization to improve overall data accuracy and to address the companies desire for new business capabilities. 

Accomplishing this is important the new reframe the way that data managed within the organization. We also can work on existing processes by focusing on day-to-day interactions with company data. With newly integrated processes and data-specific roles created through the separate data marts throughout the organization. The creation of a more centralized technological structure, we can ensure consistency between all departments. We can standardize every single piece of data that moves through Merrilton Bank. The assessment lists start with these baselines, we will be able to scale the program quickly and effectively if all these unique business capabilities are created. We can achieve this through simply adding a data governance program. Data is a proprietary resource and as should managed as such.

#### <a id="federation-gap">FEDERATION GAP</a>

One of the key portions of an effective data governance program is going to be the level of federation that it has and there is currently no federation within our organization. Having federation within the organization involves many things but mainly this is going to affect how people in our organization work with one another by creating a new department in IT that has the regulatory authority of how data is viewed throughout its lifecycle in our organization. This creates some new processes as well affects people in the organization. We need to define some data steward roles to aid the IT Department in the governance of company data. Having a single department manage the data will help to ensure data will be the same across the organization and it will be easier to manage. Defining what new types of data stewards at every single step of the data lifecycle is one way that we can make sure that data can achieve readiness. 

#### <a id="standardized-data-gap">STANDARDIZED DATA GAP</a>

Also, to follow federal regulations we need to make sure that we apply NIST standards to our data. NIST is what federal agencies use when working with data etc. Which will affect the content and data within our organization because it defines the types of data within the organization. 

#### <a id="data-management-gaps">DATA MANAGEMENT GAPS</a>

Lastly, we need to consider using specific technologies that will make the process of implementing our loan program better while also allowing us to achieve data governance readiness.  Namely, utilizing a relational database management system (RDBMS).

### C.	<a id="achieving-readiness">ACHIEVING READINESS</a>

-	Our organization needs to establish a body that will enforce all the policies set forward in the program. This new information governance board (IG board) will be created in the IT department. They will be responsible for establishing the standards used within the organization. The IG board will define the stewards of the data as well as define the roles of the people who are interacting with the data. This will be useful in the definition of processes because we will know who does what and will have a consistent standard that can be applied and enforced throughout the organization.

-	The data lifecycle of this organization can be described as authoring data, storing data, publishing/synchronizing data, enriching the data, consuming data, and analyzing the data. Placing a control or data steward at each step in this process is paramount to achieving readiness for the SBAP loan program.

-	Within our data, we need to store all data into relations that are defined by the IG board but specific to the separate departments. For example, we can have a customer relation that can be accessed by all departments, but the analysis of that data will be stored in relation specifically to the business analytics department. 

-	Utilizing a relational database management system is one way to make sure that everything is stored in one place and will help enforce data integrity. An RDBMS will make it easier to apply our algorithms as well as perform extract, transform, and load operations on the data to conduct analysis.

D.	<a id="recommendations">RECOMMENDATIONS</a> 

1.	Current tools for data collection, storage, and analytics should support the operation of SBAP. 
a.	As it now stands, we do not have the proper technological products to be able to even help us address any of the gaps found in the gaps analysis. Looking into a RDBMS technology solution is the next step in addressing the gaps the company is facing. 

2.	Disaster recovery consideration of SBAP-related data. 
a.	In case of an emergency or an audit, we need to be able to keep the records for everything to follow federal regulations mandated in the SBAP legislation. SBAP currently defines the standards for security and the types of records we must keep. So having backups and making sure that in the event Merrilton is hacked, the data can be protected and recovered. 

3.	Reuse of existing infrastructure to support SBAP-related activities. 
a.	Utilizing the statistical models will aid us in the selection of candidates for the SBAP program and it is important to discuss which models we will use for this program to keep them safe and secure. The standards the federal government sets make it so that we must share data with them. To keep our existing models safe, we need to select which ones will be used with this program. 

4.	Other observations. 
a.	Producing a timeline to implement this is important if we are to roll out this program quickly and effectively to have the most impact on the economy. We need to get a project charter set up immediately in order to make this all come together.
